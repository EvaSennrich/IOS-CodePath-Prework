The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I struggled with getting the dark mode feature and I am still trying to implement it. It took me a while to understand how to use user defaults and it was challenging having to use swift for the first time and debug my errors.
